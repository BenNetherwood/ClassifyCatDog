# ClassifyCatDog

Thanks for viewing the worked example TensorFlow Machine Learning model, which seperates images of cats vs dog with 95%+ accuracy. 
See some examples the network uses, and has learnt emergent epitopes bearing striking resemblances to pets to. Many many of these examples in the network(s) are combined, such that the output layer can classify with confidence...
